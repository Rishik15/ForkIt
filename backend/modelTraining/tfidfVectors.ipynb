Every detail of our experience exceeded our expectations. We will definitely be back.', \\\"We\\u2019ve been coming here for many years. The food ALWAYS comes hot and tasty. It sometimes takes a while, but it\\u2019s totally worth it. Zack is fantastic too. The garlic wings, fish and chips, and the pizza are my favorites. The owner is great, Zack is great, and everybody is super friendly. I\\u2019ll update this over time.\\\\n\\\\nEdit May 2023: gonna have to revise my review and remove a star, quite frankly I should remove 2. Firstly they took the seasoned potatoes off the menu some time ago, the ones that came with the garlic wings you see in my photos. A staple, gone. The excuse? We can\\u2019t get them. Ok get your own potatoes, dice them, season them and fry them. Supply chain issues are not an excuse anymore. Second, it now takes upwards of an hour to get food. They cannot handle even a half full dinning room. They are lucky the food comes piping hot and tasty. But is it worth a crazy wait? That\\u2019s for you to decide.\\\\n\\\\nTo the owner: get potatoes and dice/season them yourself. You can\\u2019t have the amazing garlic wings without the seasoned fried potatoes.\\\\n\\\\nEdit again, April 2024: Another star is coming off. The owner continues to remove good items from the menu (Edit 12/28/24, apparently the guy responsible for all these removals is no longer here, it was not all on the owner). Still no potatoes to go with the famous garlic wings, now the delicious spiral pasta and vodka sauce is gone too. In their place, frankly gross deep fried corn ball things. No thanks. Our last visit, pretty much everyone in our party had sour stomachs. Sadly, I don't think we will return for a while. Zack is still great though.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 2024. All is forgiven. The spiral pasta is back, the garlic wings are amazing, the potatoes might be coming back, and the chicken parmigiana is still world class. We love Zack as usual.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 28th, 2024: THE POTATOES WITH THE GARLIC WINGS HAVE RETURNED! I no longer sense a disturbance in the force!\\\\n\\\\nEdit: February 15th, 2024: POUTINE!!! They have poutine now and it is delicious!

Pleasantly surprised with the quality and creativity of the specials menu. We tried two dishes from this menu... Bangers with Mash and this Irish boiled bacon dish which was more like a crispy ham. Both were amazing! My companion, who has a dairy allergy, was so happy to be able to eat a great meal out. As an appetizer, we had the crispy brussel sprouts... again with all the variety of flavors and components, so good! My other companions had the brisket salad and another brisket entree, which they seemed to enjoy. We had some after dinner coffees and Irish coffees, while enjoying some live music that started at 7. It was a great dinner experience that I look forward to having again when we come back in July to see another show.\\\"]\",\n          \"['the food was so authentic felt like i was at my abuelitas house in Costa Rica again. super filling, amazing portions, kind and elegant staff, atmosphere is very homey and clean and the food is ridiculously delicious.', \\\"Extremely friendly staff always, I haven't been here in years (we loved from the area)  but I went there not to long ago again and it was great!

It sometimes takes a while, but it\\u2019s totally worth it. Zack is fantastic too. The garlic wings, fish and chips, and the pizza are my favorites. The owner is great, Zack is great, and everybody is super friendly. I\\u2019ll update this over time.\\\\n\\\\nEdit May 2023: gonna have to revise my review and remove a star, quite frankly I should remove 2. Firstly they took the seasoned potatoes off the menu some time ago, the ones that came with the garlic wings you see in my photos. A staple, gone. The excuse? We can\\u2019t get them. Ok get your own potatoes, dice them, season them and fry them. Supply chain issues are not an excuse anymore. Second, it now takes upwards of an hour to get food. They cannot handle even a half full dinning room. They are lucky the food comes piping hot and tasty. But is it worth a crazy wait? That\\u2019s for you to decide.\\\\n\\\\nTo the owner: get potatoes and dice/season them yourself. You can\\u2019t have the amazing garlic wings without the seasoned fried potatoes.\\\\n\\\\nEdit again, April 2024: Another star is coming off. The owner continues to remove good items from the menu (Edit 12/28/24, apparently the guy responsible for all these removals is no longer here, it was not all on the owner). Still no potatoes to go with the famous garlic wings, now the delicious spiral pasta and vodka sauce is gone too. In their place, frankly gross deep fried corn ball things. No thanks. Our last visit, pretty much everyone in our party had sour stomachs. Sadly, I don't think we will return for a while. Zack is still great though.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 2024. All is forgiven. The spiral pasta is back, the garlic wings are amazing, the potatoes might be coming back, and the chicken parmigiana is still world class. We love Zack as usual.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 28th, 2024: THE POTATOES WITH THE GARLIC WINGS HAVE RETURNED! I no longer sense a disturbance in the force!\\\\n\\\\nEdit: February 15th, 2024: POUTINE!!! They have poutine now and it is delicious! A little slice of Canada in New Jersey!\\\", \\\"Was in the area to see a local community theater show and decided to try out Bill's Olde Tavern for dinner beforehand. Pleasantly surprised with the quality and creativity of the specials menu. We tried two dishes from this menu... Bangers with Mash and this Irish boiled bacon dish which was more like a crispy ham. Both were amazing! My companion, who has a dairy allergy, was so happy to be able to eat a great meal out. As an appetizer, we had the crispy brussel sprouts... again with all the variety of flavors and components, so good! My other companions had the brisket salad and another brisket entree, which they seemed to enjoy. We had some after dinner coffees and Irish coffees, while enjoying some live music that started at 7. It was a great dinner experience that I look forward to having again when we come back in July to see another show.\\\"]\",\n          \"['the food was so authentic felt like i was at my abuelitas house in Costa Rica again. super filling, amazing portions, kind and elegant staff, atmosphere is very homey and clean and the food is ridiculously delicious.', \\\"Extremely friendly staff always, I haven't been here in years (we loved from the area)  but I went there not to long ago again and it was great!

I honestly could eat the pollo al ajillo every few days... it is sooooo good! I always get the same thing every single time lol. Ask for extra sauce if you want to top your rice with the chicken.   The food is fresh and flavorful. I always look forward to our lunches from Pura Vida!\\\", \\\"If you have a family and want to go then go in the day time specially with little ones.\\\\n\\\\nGreat food, arroz con pollo is ALWAYS on point! So is the chifrijo and the olla the carne on cold days is a MUST!\\\\n\\\\nThe service was ok The waitress was nice enough, but seemed tired? Or like she just didn't want to be there not sure maybe she was having an off day? Idk but it was okish.\\\\n\\\\nAlso SIDE NOTE-  look at your receipt because gratuity is automatically added to your check! This threw me off because I was about to calculate the waitress tip and then I noticed the tip was already added on there O.o so we almost left her double tip.We were only 3 people So no it was not a big group or anything for that to happen.\\\\n\\\\nWe left the area so we aren't around as much but I've gone to this place since it opened and it was a tiny place with the wood tables and all :) it has definitely grown a lot!

The first is the lottery side and the other is the deli ( bodega) side.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough there were people ahead of me   it didn't take long to place my order.

The owner is great, Zack is great, and everybody is super friendly. I\\u2019ll update this over time.\\\\n\\\\nEdit May 2023: gonna have to revise my review and remove a star, quite frankly I should remove 2. Firstly they took the seasoned potatoes off the menu some time ago, the ones that came with the garlic wings you see in my photos. A staple, gone. The excuse? We can\\u2019t get them. Ok get your own potatoes, dice them, season them and fry them. Supply chain issues are not an excuse anymore. Second, it now takes upwards of an hour to get food. They cannot handle even a half full dinning room. They are lucky the food comes piping hot and tasty. But is it worth a crazy wait? That\\u2019s for you to decide.\\\\n\\\\nTo the owner: get potatoes and dice/season them yourself. You can\\u2019t have the amazing garlic wings without the seasoned fried potatoes.\\\\n\\\\nEdit again, April 2024: Another star is coming off. The owner continues to remove good items from the menu (Edit 12/28/24, apparently the guy responsible for all these removals is no longer here, it was not all on the owner). Still no potatoes to go with the famous garlic wings, now the delicious spiral pasta and vodka sauce is gone too. In their place, frankly gross deep fried corn ball things. No thanks. Our last visit, pretty much everyone in our party had sour stomachs. Sadly, I don't think we will return for a while. Zack is still great though.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 2024. All is forgiven. The spiral pasta is back, the garlic wings are amazing, the potatoes might be coming back, and the chicken parmigiana is still world class. We love Zack as usual.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 28th, 2024: THE POTATOES WITH THE GARLIC WINGS HAVE RETURNED! I no longer sense a disturbance in the force!\\\\n\\\\nEdit: February 15th, 2024: POUTINE!!! They have poutine now and it is delicious!

Pleasantly surprised with the quality and creativity of the specials menu. We tried two dishes from this menu... Bangers with Mash and this Irish boiled bacon dish which was more like a crispy ham. Both were amazing! My companion, who has a dairy allergy, was so happy to be able to eat a great meal out. As an appetizer, we had the crispy brussel sprouts... again with all the variety of flavors and components, so good! My other companions had the brisket salad and another brisket entree, which they seemed to enjoy. We had some after dinner coffees and Irish coffees, while enjoying some live music that started at 7.

The wings and fries I wasn't a fan of as I like crispy and crunchy fries and the wings to have more flavor.\\\"] ['Delis'] \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Oh and the beer selection, at least 15 great beers on tap. 10 plus were unique and cool. Can't wait to come back and try there brunch!\\\"]\",\n          \"['Phenomenal food, excellent service, and a clean and unpretentious atmosphere. Every detail of our experience exceeded our expectations. We will definitely be back.', \\\"We\\u2019ve been coming here for many years. The food ALWAYS comes hot and tasty. It sometimes takes a while, but it\\u2019s totally worth it. Zack is fantastic too. The garlic wings, fish and chips, and the pizza are my favorites. The owner is great, Zack is great, and everybody is super friendly. I\\u2019ll update this over time.\\\\n\\\\nEdit May 2023: gonna have to revise my review and remove a star, quite frankly I should remove 2. Firstly they took the seasoned potatoes off the menu some time ago, the ones that came with the garlic wings you see in my photos. A staple, gone. The excuse? We can\\u2019t get them. Ok get your own potatoes, dice them, season them and fry them. Supply chain issues are not an excuse anymore. Second, it now takes upwards of an hour to get food. They cannot handle even a half full dinning room. They are lucky the food comes piping hot and tasty. But is it worth a crazy wait? That\\u2019s for you to decide.\\\\n\\\\nTo the owner: get potatoes and dice/season them yourself. You can\\u2019t have the amazing garlic wings without the seasoned fried potatoes.\\\\n\\\\nEdit again, April 2024: Another star is coming off. The owner continues to remove good items from the menu (Edit 12/28/24, apparently the guy responsible for all these removals is no longer here, it was not all on the owner). Still no potatoes to go with the famous garlic wings, now the delicious spiral pasta and vodka sauce is gone too. In their place, frankly gross deep fried corn ball things. No thanks. Our last visit, pretty much everyone in our party had sour stomachs. Sadly, I don't think we will return for a while. Zack is still great though.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 2024. All is forgiven. The spiral pasta is back, the garlic wings are amazing, the potatoes might be coming back, and the chicken parmigiana is still world class. We love Zack as usual.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 28th, 2024: THE POTATOES WITH THE GARLIC WINGS HAVE RETURNED! I no longer sense a disturbance in the force!\\\\n\\\\nEdit: February 15th, 2024: POUTINE!!! They have poutine now and it is delicious! A little slice of Canada in New Jersey!\\\", \\\"Was in the area to see a local community theater show and decided to try out Bill's Olde Tavern for dinner beforehand. Pleasantly surprised with the quality and creativity of the specials menu. We tried two dishes from this menu... Bangers with Mash and this Irish boiled bacon dish which was more like a crispy ham. Both were amazing! My companion, who has a dairy allergy, was so happy to be able to eat a great meal out. As an appetizer, we had the crispy brussel sprouts... again with all the variety of flavors and components, so good! My other companions had the brisket salad and another brisket entree, which they seemed to enjoy. We had some after dinner coffees and Irish coffees, while enjoying some live music that started at 7. It was a great dinner experience that I look forward to having again when we come back in July to see another show.\\\"]\",\n          \"['the food was so authentic felt like i was at my abuelitas house in Costa Rica again. super filling, amazing portions, kind and elegant staff, atmosphere is very homey and clean and the food is ridiculously delicious.', \\\"Extremely friendly staff always, I haven't been here in years (we loved from the area)  but I went there not to long ago again and it was great!

I honestly could eat the pollo al ajillo every few days... it is sooooo good! I always get the same thing every single time lol. Ask for extra sauce if you want to top your rice with the chicken.   The food is fresh and flavorful. I always look forward to our lunches from Pura Vida!\\\", \\\"If you have a family and want to go then go in the day time specially with little ones.\\\\n\\\\nGreat food, arroz con pollo is ALWAYS on point! So is the chifrijo and the olla the carne on cold days is a MUST!\\\\n\\\\nThe service was ok The waitress was nice enough, but seemed tired? Or like she just didn't want to be there not sure maybe she was having an off day? Idk but it was okish.\\\\n\\\\nAlso SIDE NOTE-  look at your receipt because gratuity is automatically added to your check! This threw me off because I was about to calculate the waitress tip and then I noticed the tip was already added on there O.o so we almost left her double tip.We were only 3 people So no it was not a big group or anything for that to happen.\\\\n\\\\nWe left the area so we aren't around as much but I've gone to this place since it opened and it was a tiny place with the wood tables and all :) it has definitely grown a lot!

The first is the lottery side and the other is the deli ( bodega) side.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough there were people ahead of me   it didn't take long to place my order.

Every detail of our experience exceeded our expectations. We will definitely be back.', \\\"We\\u2019ve been coming here for many years. The food ALWAYS comes hot and tasty. It sometimes takes a while, but it\\u2019s totally worth it. Zack is fantastic too. The garlic wings, fish and chips, and the pizza are my favorites. The owner is great, Zack is great, and everybody is super friendly. I\\u2019ll update this over time.\\\\n\\\\nEdit May 2023: gonna have to revise my review and remove a star, quite frankly I should remove 2. Firstly they took the seasoned potatoes off the menu some time ago, the ones that came with the garlic wings you see in my photos. A staple, gone. The excuse? We can\\u2019t get them. Ok get your own potatoes, dice them, season them and fry them. Supply chain issues are not an excuse anymore. Second, it now takes upwards of an hour to get food. They cannot handle even a half full dinning room. They are lucky the food comes piping hot and tasty. But is it worth a crazy wait? That\\u2019s for you to decide.\\\\n\\\\nTo the owner: get potatoes and dice/season them yourself. You can\\u2019t have the amazing garlic wings without the seasoned fried potatoes.\\\\n\\\\nEdit again, April 2024: Another star is coming off. The owner continues to remove good items from the menu (Edit 12/28/24, apparently the guy responsible for all these removals is no longer here, it was not all on the owner). Still no potatoes to go with the famous garlic wings, now the delicious spiral pasta and vodka sauce is gone too. In their place, frankly gross deep fried corn ball things. No thanks. Our last visit, pretty much everyone in our party had sour stomachs. Sadly, I don't think we will return for a while. Zack is still great though.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 2024. All is forgiven. The spiral pasta is back, the garlic wings are amazing, the potatoes might be coming back, and the chicken parmigiana is still world class. We love Zack as usual.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 28th, 2024: THE POTATOES WITH THE GARLIC WINGS HAVE RETURNED! I no longer sense a disturbance in the force!\\\\n\\\\nEdit: February 15th, 2024: POUTINE!!! They have poutine now and it is delicious! A little slice of Canada in New Jersey!\\\", \\\"Was in the area to see a local community theater show and decided to try out Bill's Olde Tavern for dinner beforehand. Pleasantly surprised with the quality and creativity of the specials menu. We tried two dishes from this menu... Bangers with Mash and this Irish boiled bacon dish which was more like a crispy ham. Both were amazing! My companion, who has a dairy allergy, was so happy to be able to eat a great meal out. As an appetizer, we had the crispy brussel sprouts... again with all the variety of flavors and components, so good! My other companions had the brisket salad and another brisket entree, which they seemed to enjoy. We had some after dinner coffees and Irish coffees, while enjoying some live music that started at 7. It was a great dinner experience that I look forward to having again when we come back in July to see another show.\\\"]\",\n          \"['the food was so authentic felt like i was at my abuelitas house in Costa Rica again. super filling, amazing portions, kind and elegant staff, atmosphere is very homey and clean and the food is ridiculously delicious.', \\\"Extremely friendly staff always, I haven't been here in years (we loved from the area)  but I went there not to long ago again and it was great!

Every detail of our experience exceeded our expectations. We will definitely be back.', \\\"We\\u2019ve been coming here for many years. The food ALWAYS comes hot and tasty. It sometimes takes a while, but it\\u2019s totally worth it. Zack is fantastic too. The garlic wings, fish and chips, and the pizza are my favorites. The owner is great, Zack is great, and everybody is super friendly. I\\u2019ll update this over time.\\\\n\\\\nEdit May 2023: gonna have to revise my review and remove a star, quite frankly I should remove 2. Firstly they took the seasoned potatoes off the menu some time ago, the ones that came with the garlic wings you see in my photos. A staple, gone. The excuse? We can\\u2019t get them. Ok get your own potatoes, dice them, season them and fry them. Supply chain issues are not an excuse anymore. Second, it now takes upwards of an hour to get food. They cannot handle even a half full dinning room. They are lucky the food comes piping hot and tasty. But is it worth a crazy wait? That\\u2019s for you to decide.\\\\n\\\\nTo the owner: get potatoes and dice/season them yourself. You can\\u2019t have the amazing garlic wings without the seasoned fried potatoes.\\\\n\\\\nEdit again, April 2024: Another star is coming off. The owner continues to remove good items from the menu (Edit 12/28/24, apparently the guy responsible for all these removals is no longer here, it was not all on the owner). Still no potatoes to go with the famous garlic wings, now the delicious spiral pasta and vodka sauce is gone too. In their place, frankly gross deep fried corn ball things. No thanks. Our last visit, pretty much everyone in our party had sour stomachs. Sadly, I don't think we will return for a while. Zack is still great though.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 2024. All is forgiven. The spiral pasta is back, the garlic wings are amazing, the potatoes might be coming back, and the chicken parmigiana is still world class. We love Zack as usual.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 28th, 2024: THE POTATOES WITH THE GARLIC WINGS HAVE RETURNED! I no longer sense a disturbance in the force!\\\\n\\\\nEdit: February 15th, 2024: POUTINE!!! They have poutine now and it is delicious! A little slice of Canada in New Jersey!\\\", \\\"Was in the area to see a local community theater show and decided to try out Bill's Olde Tavern for dinner beforehand. Pleasantly surprised with the quality and creativity of the specials menu. We tried two dishes from this menu... Bangers with Mash and this Irish boiled bacon dish which was more like a crispy ham. Both were amazing! My companion, who has a dairy allergy, was so happy to be able to eat a great meal out. As an appetizer, we had the crispy brussel sprouts... again with all the variety of flavors and components, so good! My other companions had the brisket salad and another brisket entree, which they seemed to enjoy. We had some after dinner coffees and Irish coffees, while enjoying some live music that started at 7. It was a great dinner experience that I look forward to having again when we come back in July to see another show.\\\"]\",\n          \"['the food was so authentic felt like i was at my abuelitas house in Costa Rica again. super filling, amazing portions, kind and elegant staff, atmosphere is very homey and clean and the food is ridiculously delicious.', \\\"Extremely friendly staff always, I haven't been here in years (we loved from the area)  but I went there not to long ago again and it was great!
