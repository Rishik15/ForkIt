Oh and the beer selection, at least 15 great beers on tap. 10 plus were unique and cool. Can't wait to come back and try there brunch!\\\"]\",\n          \"['Phenomenal food, excellent service, and a clean and unpretentious atmosphere. Every detail of our experience exceeded our expectations. We will definitely be back.', \\\"We\\u2019ve been coming here for many years. The food ALWAYS comes hot and tasty. It sometimes takes a while, but it\\u2019s totally worth it. Zack is fantastic too. The garlic wings, fish and chips, and the pizza are my favorites. The owner is great, Zack is great, and everybody is super friendly. I\\u2019ll update this over time.\\\\n\\\\nEdit May 2023: gonna have to revise my review and remove a star, quite frankly I should remove 2. Firstly they took the seasoned potatoes off the menu some time ago, the ones that came with the garlic wings you see in my photos. A staple, gone. The excuse? We can\\u2019t get them. Ok get your own potatoes, dice them, season them and fry them. Supply chain issues are not an excuse anymore. Second, it now takes upwards of an hour to get food. They cannot handle even a half full dinning room. They are lucky the food comes piping hot and tasty. But is it worth a crazy wait? That\\u2019s for you to decide.\\\\n\\\\nTo the owner: get potatoes and dice/season them yourself. You can\\u2019t have the amazing garlic wings without the seasoned fried potatoes.\\\\n\\\\nEdit again, April 2024: Another star is coming off. The owner continues to remove good items from the menu (Edit 12/28/24, apparently the guy responsible for all these removals is no longer here, it was not all on the owner). Still no potatoes to go with the famous garlic wings, now the delicious spiral pasta and vodka sauce is gone too. In their place, frankly gross deep fried corn ball things. No thanks. Our last visit, pretty much everyone in our party had sour stomachs. Sadly, I don't think we will return for a while. Zack is still great though.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 2024. All is forgiven. The spiral pasta is back, the garlic wings are amazing, the potatoes might be coming back, and the chicken parmigiana is still world class. We love Zack as usual.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 28th, 2024: THE POTATOES WITH THE GARLIC WINGS HAVE RETURNED! I no longer sense a disturbance in the force!\\\\n\\\\nEdit: February 15th, 2024: POUTINE!!! They have poutine now and it is delicious! A little slice of Canada in New Jersey!\\\", \\\"Was in the area to see a local community theater show and decided to try out Bill's Olde Tavern for dinner beforehand. Pleasantly surprised with the quality and creativity of the specials menu. We tried two dishes from this menu... Bangers with Mash and this Irish boiled bacon dish which was more like a crispy ham. Both were amazing! My companion, who has a dairy allergy, was so happy to be able to eat a great meal out. As an appetizer, we had the crispy brussel sprouts... again with all the variety of flavors and components, so good! My other companions had the brisket salad and another brisket entree, which they seemed to enjoy. We had some after dinner coffees and Irish coffees, while enjoying some live music that started at 7. It was a great dinner experience that I look forward to having again when we come back in July to see another show.\\\"]\",\n          \"['the food was so authentic felt like i was at my abuelitas house in Costa Rica again. super filling, amazing portions, kind and elegant staff, atmosphere is very homey and clean and the food is ridiculously delicious.', \\\"Extremely friendly staff always, I haven't been here in years (we loved from the area)  but I went there not to long ago again and it was great!

They charged you $7 just for half pepperoni pizza the offer is $24 95 for a large cheese pizza, 12 wings and a 2 litter soda but if you ask for half pepperoni pizza it goes up $31 95 really ridiculous when you don't even bring napkins, plates, utensils and must of the times the pizza arrived cold. If you include delivery fees please let us the customers know. I pay with a devid card and I told the employee to include $4.00 for the delivery guy.

Wasn't bad but I wish the menu was a little more specific, felt very out of place with the rest of the bites.\\\", \\\"When I went to Aperitivo Leah was server.

Share delectable tapas-style dishes and sip on our enticing aperitifs. Whether you\\'re seeking a romantic evening or a casual gathering, Aperitivo Bar invites you to embrace the Italian tradition of \"aperitivo.\" \"Nice wine selection, cocktails are very aperitif in nature (which is to be expected).   Food is simple, well portioned, and tasty without being too heavy.  Seating is cozy and comfortable as well.\\\\n\\\\nWas disappointed in the Venetian tuna however.   Was literally just a $13 gas station tuna salad sandwich. Wasnt bad but I wish the menu was a little more specific, felt very out of place with the rest of the bites.\", \"When I went to Aperitivo Leah was server. Friendly, knowlegable really good.\\\\nHad limoncello martini, tuna tea sandwiches that had Itslian olives in them and the Fario salad. Delicious and able to share with friend. Had the Tiramisu was to die for. The best I ever had. Also Chef delivered the food and the managers were walking around making sure everyone was well taking care of\\\\nWonderful experience. Cant wait to go back again\", \"Stepping through the doors is a portal to an international destination of vibrant olive trees outlining a rustic driveway to an Italian al fresco-inspired retreat. A ritual of whetting the appetite with herbaceous bubbly cocktails and herbed small, yet enough for 2, sharable plates.\\\\n\\\\nThe citrus-fresh vibe is so unlike anything in Pennington you are not sure where you are. But the moment you sink down into a wicker bar stool or a bistro side table you know youre not in 08534.\\\\n\\\\nThe food is best described as sharable…dont settle for one flavor. But taste the melding of a fine olive oil (EVOO) and a delicious homemade focaccia paired with a salad, fish or fine meat. Point is…dont just get one thing, but two things (really, why stop there, except to remember theres still gelato or rum cake ahead). The delightfully fresh ingredients are served on immaculate blue rimmed plates and the servers are attentive and as vibrant as the blue bookcase decor.\\\\n\\\\nBottles of Prosecco and other kinds of Italian aperitifs line one whole wall plus the backdrop of the small-space bar (the small hilltop-of-a-winery atmosphere only has room for 36 diners) while a large high top table is the center of the main area. Which would be perfect for a girls’ nite or even an office gathering happy hour. Off to the side, a small sette and coffee table is reminiscent of a place under the Tuscan sun. Not without a few date-friendly bistro tables, perfect for a cocktail or a small bite.\\\\n\\\\nDont let the off the beaten path of location between a Fed Ex office and a dry cleaners deter from the unique atmosphere of this place.\\\\n\\\\nAperitivo Bar is a piccolo of Prosecco-sprinkled bliss that momentarily takes you out of NJ and into the Italian countryside. And dont miss the Aperol Spritz selfie spot to remember the moment. Buon appetito!!!\" Italian, Tapas/Small Plates moderate fair mid-price reasonable average'"

It sometimes takes a while, but it\\u2019s totally worth it. Zack is fantastic too. The garlic wings, fish and chips, and the pizza are my favorites. The owner is great, Zack is great, and everybody is super friendly. I\\u2019ll update this over time.\\\\n\\\\nEdit May 2023: gonna have to revise my review and remove a star, quite frankly I should remove 2. Firstly they took the seasoned potatoes off the menu some time ago, the ones that came with the garlic wings you see in my photos. A staple, gone. The excuse? We can\\u2019t get them. Ok get your own potatoes, dice them, season them and fry them. Supply chain issues are not an excuse anymore. Second, it now takes upwards of an hour to get food. They cannot handle even a half full dinning room. They are lucky the food comes piping hot and tasty. But is it worth a crazy wait? That\\u2019s for you to decide.\\\\n\\\\nTo the owner: get potatoes and dice/season them yourself. You can\\u2019t have the amazing garlic wings without the seasoned fried potatoes.\\\\n\\\\nEdit again, April 2024: Another star is coming off. The owner continues to remove good items from the menu (Edit 12/28/24, apparently the guy responsible for all these removals is no longer here, it was not all on the owner). Still no potatoes to go with the famous garlic wings, now the delicious spiral pasta and vodka sauce is gone too. In their place, frankly gross deep fried corn ball things. No thanks. Our last visit, pretty much everyone in our party had sour stomachs. Sadly, I dont think we will return for a while. Zack is still great though.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 2024. All is forgiven. The spiral pasta is back, the garlic wings are amazing, the potatoes might be coming back, and the chicken parmigiana is still world class. We love Zack as usual.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 28th, 2024: THE POTATOES WITH THE GARLIC WINGS HAVE RETURNED! I no longer sense a disturbance in the force!\\\\n\\\\nEdit: February 15th, 2024: POUTINE!!! They have poutine now and it is delicious! A little slice of Canada in New Jersey!\\\", \\\"Was in the area to see a local community theater show and decided to try out Bills Olde Tavern for dinner beforehand. Pleasantly surprised with the quality and creativity of the specials menu. We tried two dishes from this menu... Bangers with Mash and this Irish boiled bacon dish which was more like a crispy ham. Both were amazing! My companion, who has a dairy allergy, was so happy to be able to eat a great meal out. As an appetizer, we had the crispy brussel sprouts... again with all the variety of flavors and components, so good! My other companions had the brisket salad and another brisket entree, which they seemed to enjoy. We had some after dinner coffees and Irish coffees, while enjoying some live music that started at 7. It was a great dinner experience that I look forward to having again when we come back in July to see another show.\\\"\",\n          \"the food was so authentic felt like i was at my abuelitas house in Costa Rica again. super filling, amazing portions, kind and elegant staff, atmosphere is very homey and clean and the food is ridiculously delicious., \\\"Extremely friendly staff always, I havent been here in years (we loved from the area)  but I went there not to long ago again and it was great!

The best beef bacon egg and cheese in the World! Compliments to the chef.\\\\n\\\\nPhoto: beef bacon, egg, and extra cheese. Bread, buttered and toasted with mayo, fried onions, black pepper., \\\"Was in the area and decided to give this place a try. The parking lot was packed which made me feel like the food definitely had to be good. Upon entrance the store is broken down into two parts. The first is the lottery side and the other is the deli ( bodega) side.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough there were people ahead of me   it didnt take long to place my order. I got the chopped cheese sandwich along with wings and fries. I never had chopped cheese before so when asked how I want it? I told them to make it however they normally do.\\\\n\\\\nThe chopped cheese came with lettuce which was my only issue ( my own fault \\ud83d\\ude2d\\ud83d\\ude2d) after removing most of it the sandwich was bussin!!!  The wings and fries I wasnt a fan of as I like crispy and crunchy fries and the wings to have more flavor.\\\" Delis cheap inexpensive low-price low-cost economical economic affordable\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Processed_Text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 465,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"pura vida neighborhood restaurant lounge feature menu costa rican dish karaoke dj simple service superb attention waitressing staff patient knowledgeable dish although costarican theme menu expand spanish limit one style cuisine must army kitchen super organize wait food minute party people skilled bartender stingy drink portion good ordered mojito lime power mint rum right bathroom well organize ive never din team order staff lunch twice month honestly could eat pollo al ajillo every day sooooo good always get thing every single time lol ask extra sauce want top rice chicken food fresh flavorful always look forward lunch pura vida family want go go day time specially little food arroz con pollo always point chifrijo olla carne cold day must service ok waitress nice enough seem tire like didnt want sure maybe day idk side look receipt gratuity automatically add check throw calculate waitress tip notice tip already add almost leave double people big group anything left area arent around much ive go place since open tiny place wood table definitely grow lot food remain good latin american moderate fair reasonable average\",\n          \"ila mae restaurant soul food include breakfast sandwich seafood casserole serve cozy space go coworker lunch excite turkey wing unfortunately find brown curly hair yam turn taste turkey wing raw consume already spend money sick hour later work never return love support black business need better especially come sanitation come funeral look place eat find lla maes let tell place amaze wonderful service food point hospitality excellent regret go im cook self know whats good back lla maes staff outstanding visit hidden gem trenton today ila disappoint truth fish sandwich hook absolutely delicious definitely back try item menu one love soul food breakfast brunch burger cheap inexpensive economical economic affordable\",\n          \"lucky deli lawrenceville lucky deli popular eatery know appetizing chop cheese sandwich breakfast sandwich customer highly recommend mozzarella stick marinara sauce well area take chance place let tell chopped cheese phenomenal best mozzarella stick ever along marinara sauce highly recommend spot definitely new favorite thing much lettuce would ask light lettuce prefer breakfast sandwich fawkk good good best beef bacon egg cheese world compliment beef bacon egg extra cheese bread butter toast mayo fried onion black area decide give place try parking lot pack make feel like food definitely good upon entrance store break two part first lottery side deli bodega people ahead didnt take long place order get chop cheese sandwich along wing fry never chop cheese ask want tell make however normally chopped cheese come lettuce issue fault remove sandwich bussin wing fry wasnt fan like crispy crunchy fry wing flavor deli cheap inexpensive economical economic affordable\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

I\\u2019ll update this over time.\\\\n\\\\nEdit May 2023: gonna have to revise my review and remove a star, quite frankly I should remove 2. Firstly they took the seasoned potatoes off the menu some time ago, the ones that came with the garlic wings you see in my photos. A staple, gone. The excuse? We can\\u2019t get them. Ok get your own potatoes, dice them, season them and fry them. Supply chain issues are not an excuse anymore. Second, it now takes upwards of an hour to get food. They cannot handle even a half full dinning room. They are lucky the food comes piping hot and tasty. But is it worth a crazy wait? That\\u2019s for you to decide.\\\\n\\\\nTo the owner: get potatoes and dice/season them yourself. You can\\u2019t have the amazing garlic wings without the seasoned fried potatoes.\\\\n\\\\nEdit again, April 2024: Another star is coming off. The owner continues to remove good items from the menu (Edit 12/28/24, apparently the guy responsible for all these removals is no longer here, it was not all on the owner). Still no potatoes to go with the famous garlic wings, now the delicious spiral pasta and vodka sauce is gone too. In their place, frankly gross deep fried corn ball things. No thanks. Our last visit, pretty much everyone in our party had sour stomachs. Sadly, I don't think we will return for a while. Zack is still great though.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 2024. All is forgiven. The spiral pasta is back, the garlic wings are amazing, the potatoes might be coming back, and the chicken parmigiana is still world class. We love Zack as usual.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 28th, 2024: THE POTATOES WITH THE GARLIC WINGS HAVE RETURNED!

Pleasantly surprised with the quality and creativity of the specials menu. We tried two dishes from this menu... Bangers with Mash and this Irish boiled bacon dish which was more like a crispy ham. Both were amazing! My companion, who has a dairy allergy, was so happy to be able to eat a great meal out. As an appetizer, we had the crispy brussel sprouts... again with all the variety of flavors and components, so good! My other companions had the brisket salad and another brisket entree, which they seemed to enjoy. We had some after dinner coffees and Irish coffees, while enjoying some live music that started at 7.

The owner is great, Zack is great, and everybody is super friendly. I\\u2019ll update this over time.\\\\n\\\\nEdit May 2023: gonna have to revise my review and remove a star, quite frankly I should remove 2. Firstly they took the seasoned potatoes off the menu some time ago, the ones that came with the garlic wings you see in my photos. A staple, gone. The excuse? We can\\u2019t get them. Ok get your own potatoes, dice them, season them and fry them. Supply chain issues are not an excuse anymore. Second, it now takes upwards of an hour to get food. They cannot handle even a half full dinning room. They are lucky the food comes piping hot and tasty. But is it worth a crazy wait? That\\u2019s for you to decide.\\\\n\\\\nTo the owner: get potatoes and dice/season them yourself. You can\\u2019t have the amazing garlic wings without the seasoned fried potatoes.\\\\n\\\\nEdit again, April 2024: Another star is coming off. The owner continues to remove good items from the menu (Edit 12/28/24, apparently the guy responsible for all these removals is no longer here, it was not all on the owner). Still no potatoes to go with the famous garlic wings, now the delicious spiral pasta and vodka sauce is gone too. In their place, frankly gross deep fried corn ball things. No thanks. Our last visit, pretty much everyone in our party had sour stomachs. Sadly, I don't think we will return for a while. Zack is still great though.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 2024. All is forgiven. The spiral pasta is back, the garlic wings are amazing, the potatoes might be coming back, and the chicken parmigiana is still world class. We love Zack as usual.\\\\n\\\\nEdit: December 28th, 2024: THE POTATOES WITH THE GARLIC WINGS HAVE RETURNED!

Pleasantly surprised with the quality and creativity of the specials menu. We tried two dishes from this menu... Bangers with Mash and this Irish boiled bacon dish which was more like a crispy ham. Both were amazing! My companion, who has a dairy allergy, was so happy to be able to eat a great meal out. As an appetizer, we had the crispy brussel sprouts... again with all the variety of flavors and components, so good! My other companions had the brisket salad and another brisket entree, which they seemed to enjoy. We had some after dinner coffees and Irish coffees, while enjoying some live music that started at 7.
